# MLKA-Data
This is some specific data for testing the [MLKA-Bash-data](https://github.com/HughP/MLKA-Bash-data) script. The idea is to download this data to test the script.

The idea is that the Bash-data-MLKA script will copy this test data over into its folders when it cleans up from various tests. This is exicuted when `.clean-up.sh` is run.
